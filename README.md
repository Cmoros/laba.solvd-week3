### Assignment

Make a function to calc n-th fibonacci number with caching.

    the n-th Fibonacci number is the sum of the (n-1)th and the (n-2)th.
    So to calculate the 100th Fibonacci number, for instance, we need to compute all the 99 values before it first.

Please do caching in 2 ways, one with Map and one with WeakMap
